# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Delphi Platform to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Email Validation
- Comprehensive email format validation using RFC-compliant regex
- Maximum length enforcement (254 characters)
- Domain validation

#### Text Input Sanitization
- HTML entity escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- Maximum length enforcement for all text fields
- Character validation for names and specialized fields
- Removal of excessive whitespace

#### Phone Number Validation
- International format support with proper validation
- Removal of formatting characters before validation

### 2. Rate Limiting

#### Email Sending
- Maximum 3 emails per 5 minutes per email address
- Prevents spam and abuse of email functionality

#### Form Submissions
- Maximum 10 form submissions per minute per user
- Prevents automated attacks and abuse

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Restrictive CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Limited script sources to trusted domains
- Prevents inline script execution (except for development)

### 4. Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Limits referrer information leakage

### 5. Edge Function Security

#### CORS Configuration
- Restricted CORS origins in production
- Limited to trusted domains only
- Proper preflight handling

#### Input Validation
- Email format validation before processing
- Subject and content length limits
- Rate limiting per email address

### 6. Database Security

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS policies enforced
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper authentication checks on all operations

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- No raw SQL execution in edge functions
- Input sanitization before database operations

## Security Best Practices Followed

### Authentication
- Secure session management with Supabase Auth
- Proper token validation
- Session expiration handling

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data is never logged
- Email addresses are case-normalized and trimmed
- Personal information is properly escaped in email templates

### Error Handling
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for security events (server-side only)
- No sensitive information in client-side error messages

## Removed Security Risks

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials
- **FIXED**: Removed hardcoded admin credentials from migration files
- Admin users should be created through proper Supabase Auth API

### 2. HTML Injection in Emails
- **FIXED**: All user input in email templates is properly sanitized
- HTML entities are escaped to prevent XSS

### 3. Overly Permissive CORS
- **FIXED**: CORS is now restricted to trusted domains in production
- Development mode still allows all origins for local development

## Security Configuration

The application uses a centralized security configuration in `src/config/security.ts` that defines:
- Input validation limits
- Rate limiting settings
- Content Security Policy rules
- Allowed file types and sizes

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Rate Limiting Monitoring
- Rate limit violations are logged
- Automatic cleanup of old rate limit entries

### Security Event Logging
- Email sending attempts and failures
- Authentication events
- Form submission patterns

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Implement CSRF tokens for form submissions
2. Add file upload security scanning
3. Implement proper audit logging
4. Add intrusion detection capabilities
5. Implement API key rotation mechanisms

### Recommendations for Production
1. Set up proper monitoring and alerting
2. Regular security audits and penetration testing
3. Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
4. Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
5. Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:
1. Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] All environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] CORS settings are configured for production domains
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled and configured
- [ ] Security headers are properly set
- [ ] SSL/TLS is properly configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies are tested and verified
- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Logging is configured but doesn't log sensitive data
- [ ] Regular security updates are scheduled
